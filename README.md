# Brightcove Salesforce Plugin

The purpose of this project is to provide a Package that can 
be installed that integrates Brightcove with Salesforce Knowledge using 
Brightcoves' API's that are available.

The solution consist of two parts:
1. A component that can be inserted into the Page Layout of a Knowledge Management article
which provides the capability to navigate through the Brightcove video library and associate 
the article with a Video.
2. A Player Lightning component which can be used to gather the information about the video
associated with an article to display a player within the community.
